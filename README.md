## Overview

### Description

Allows users to test their trading strategies with no financial consequences by simulating a risk-free trading experience. A user can see real-time cryptocurrencies and build a financial portfolio.

## Networking

CoinGecko's Crypto API is used in the project. An `API KEY` is not provided for security purposes.

## Tech Stack Used

### SwiftUI

SwiftUI is used to build the user interface of the app. It provides a declarative Swift syntax that allows for easy and intuitive UI development. With SwiftUI, the app includes various features such as real-time crypto updates, detailed information pages, and a portfolio management page.

### Combine

Combine framework is used for handling asynchronous events and data streams within the app. It helps in managing state and reacting to changes in data, such as real-time updates from the CoinGecko API.

### CoinGecko API

CoinGecko's Crypto API provides real-time cryptocurrency data. It includes endpoints for fetching market data, detailed coin information, and more. The app utilizes this API to display up-to-date information about cryptocurrencies, enabling users to make informed trading decisions in the simulator.

### Figma

Figma is used for creating prototypes and wireframes. It helps in designing the app's layout and user flow, ensuring a user-friendly experience. The wireframes and mockups guide the development process, making sure the final product meets the design specifications.

### GitHub

GitHub is used for version control and project management. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on the project, track changes, and manage the codebase effectively. The repository includes detailed documentation, issues tracking, and version history.

### Xcode

Xcode is the primary development environment for iOS development. It includes tools for writing, debugging, and testing SwiftUI code. Xcode's simulator and device testing features ensure the app runs smoothly on various iOS devices.

## Closing Notes

This is my first big project in Swift, and I am incredibly proud of what I have achieved. The journey has been challenging yet rewarding, and this project has helped me grow as a developer. I am excited to share it with the world and look forward to building even more sophisticated apps in the future. Also, I would like to note that this iOS app would not be where it is now without Nick Sarno and his amazing help with manuevering through Swift in order to make this application what it is today. And thank you to everyone that has supported me throughout this journey, I appreciate you all!
